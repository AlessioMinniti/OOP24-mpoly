Monopoly Rules


Objective:
The goal of the game is to become the wealthiest player by buying, renting, and selling properties.


Setup:
Each player chooses a name and a token color.
Each player receives an initial amount of money from the Bank to begin the game.


The Bank:
The Bank manages the following:
Holds Title Deed cards and houses before they are purchased.
Pays salaries and bonuses.
Sells properties and distributes the corresponding Title Deed cards.
Sells houses and grants mortgages when needed.
Collects taxes and property payments.
The Bank never goes bankrupt.


The Play:
Players take turns rolling the dice and moving their token forward the number of spaces shown.
After finishing a turn, the next player proceeds.
Tokens remain on the space where they landed and resume from that point next turn.
Multiple tokens can share the same space.
Depending on where you land, you may:
    - Buy properties
    - Pay rent or taxes
    - Draw a Chance or Community Chest card
    - Be sent to Jail


"Start":
Every time a player passes or lands on "Start", they collect $200 from the Bank.


Buying Property:
If you land on an unowned property, you may buy it from the Bank at its printed price.
As proof of ownership, the tile will'show a badge with the same token color of its owner.


Paying Rent:
If you land on property owned by another player, you must pay them rent as listed on the Title Deed.
If a player owns all properties in a color group, they may charge double rent for those without houses.
Rent increases significantly when houses are built.


"CHANCE / CHEST":
When you land on these spaces, draw a card from the deck and follow its instructions immediately.


"INCOME TAX":
If you land on the Income Tax space, you must pay the relative amount to the Bank.


"JAIL":
You go to Jail if:
    - You land on the “Go to Jail” space.
    - You draw a “Go to Jail” card.
Rules while in Jail:
    - Your token will move directly to Jail without collect the $200 for passing "Start".
    - Your turn ends immediately.
    - Jail time lasts for 3 turn, unless you get at least 2 matching numbers at the dices.
    - You can still collect rent from other players.


"FREE PARKING":
Landing on Free Parking puts you in stall for the next turn.


Houses:
If you own all properties in a color group, you may buy houses from the Bank and build them on those properties.
The cost per house is listed on the property’s Title Deed card.
Each property has a limit to how many houses it can hold. After you reach the limit of houses, you can sell them to buy an hotel.
Even without houses, complete ownership of a color group allows double rent.
Houses and hotels can only be purchased homogeneously, one for each properties in the same color group. 


Selling:
Unimproved properties, railroads, and utilities may be sold back to the Bank.
Properties cannot be sold if there are houses on any properties in that color group.
Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank homogeneously (like when purchased), for half their purchase price.


Bankruptcy:
- Classic Mode: A player is declared bankrupt if their bank account is negative at the end of their turn.
- Infinity Mode: Players can continue playing regardless of balance.
When you go bankrupt, all your properties are automatically returned to the Bank.


Other Rules:
Every payment have to go through the bank.
Players may not loan or borrow money from each other.
